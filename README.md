Extracting Insights from the World Top Chess Players Dataset

To analyze the "World Top Chess Players (August 2020)" dataset, we begin by loading the dataset using Pandas, a powerful Python library for data manipulation. We clean the dataset by handling any missing values and focus on distinguishing between active and inactive players using the Inactive_flag column.

With Seaborn and Matplotlib, we generate visualizations such as:

Distribution of player ratings to understand the spread of FIDE ratings.
Rating comparisons between active and inactive players using box plots.
Top players by country or rating to analyze the geographic distribution of elite players.
By leveraging Pythonâ€™s data analysis libraries, we extract valuable insights regarding the status and distribution of top chess players across various dimensions like rating, activity status, and nationality.
